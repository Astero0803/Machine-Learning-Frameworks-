# Machine Learning Frameworks: PyTorch & TensorFlow

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for learning and implementing machine learning models using two popular frameworks: PyTorch and TensorFlow. Each notebook demonstrates the basic workflow for creating and training models, providing a clear comparison between the two frameworks.

## Repository Structure
- **pytorch/**: Contains the PyTorch notebook and related dependencies.
  - `20240930~1001_pytorch.ipynb`: Notebook for learning basic PyTorch operations and building neural networks.
  - `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for running the PyTorch notebook.

- **tensorflow/**: Contains the TensorFlow notebook and related dependencies.
  - `2024_10_01_Tensorflow.ipynb`: Notebook for learning TensorFlow basics and building models using the Keras API.
  - `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for running the TensorFlow notebook.

## Key Learning Points
1. **PyTorch Notebook**: Covers tensor manipulations, neural network construction, data loading, and model training using PyTorch.
2. **TensorFlow Notebook**: Focuses on tensor operations, model building using Keras, data preparation, and model training.
